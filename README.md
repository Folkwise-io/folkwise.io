## Installation instructions

### Install ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick

On ubuntu:

```

### Install Fira Sans Regular (if you're working with the social media preview)

You'll need [Fira Sans Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans?query=fira+sans), so you'll have to [install it](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=install+font+in+ubuntu)... maybe by extracting the ttf fonts to `~/.fonts`

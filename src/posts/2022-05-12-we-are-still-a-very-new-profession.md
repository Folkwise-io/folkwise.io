Software engineers may have had an outsized impact on the world. But we forget how incredibly *new* software engineering is. 

Lawyers have more than 2,000 years on us. Architects, doctors, accountants and teachers even more so.

Maybe it would be wise to consider that maybe, just maybe, we barely know what we're doing. 

Maybe we should take a page out of other professionals' books.

Can we learn from other professions how to:
* explain what we do better?
* protect our interests?
* train our students?
* express our value?
* self-regulate?

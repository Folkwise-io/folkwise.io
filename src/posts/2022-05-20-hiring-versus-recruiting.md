Some recent hard learnings for me around hiring & recruiting...

When recruiting, minimize false negatives.
i.e. rejecting someone you should have sent forward

But when hiring, minimize false positives.
i.e. hiring someone you shouldn't have offered to

Trust when recruiting. Verify when hiring. Mistakes happen when you do the opposite.

(Recruiting = attracting talent, hiring = sending an offer)

&nbsp;&nbsp;Some recent hard learnings for me around hiring & recruiting...

&nbsp;&nbsp;When recruiting, minimize false negatives.
i.e. rejecting someone you should have sent forward

&nbsp;&nbsp;But when hiring, minimize false positives.
i.e. hiring someone you shouldn't have offered to

&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust when recruiting. Verify when hiring. Mistakes happen when you do the opposite.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Recruiting = attracting talent, hiring = sending an offer)

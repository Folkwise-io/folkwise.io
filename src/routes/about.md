# About Me

My name is Monarch Wadia. I'm a senior software developer and startup CEO, and my work centers around the intersection of software engineering and online community building.

I live with my wife in the suburbs of Toronto, Canada. I enjoy taking long walks in nature, reading science fiction, listening to King Crimson, and watching Star Trek. My friends think I'm a geek, and I whole-heartedly agree.

## As a businessperson

In the past 5 years, I've also founded 2 startups as a technical CEO. 
  1. Zero Projects was a software development firm that created MVPs for startups and did digital transformation for larger firms. We completed ~50 projects and grew to a team of 10 in 2.5 years.
  2. Mintbean was a hiring hackathon community for junior developers that helped new coders build confidence and gain skills. We held 95 hackathons, 300+ workshops, a 500-person conference, and 10k users in 2.5 years.

## As a software developer

I have 10 years of hands-on experience as a fullstack developer.

* **Frontend:** I've enjoy writing in all of the Big 4 SPA frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) as well as some older ones (Backbone, Ext.js, jQuery) and some less common ones (D3.js, Phaser.js). I like using both TypeScript and JavaScript.
* **Backend:** I've worked in Node.js, Java, and Ruby on Rails. I'm comfortable with writing opinionated code as well as minimalistic code in both OOP and functional paradigms.
* **Other:** I've also created hybrid mobile applications for Zebra handheld devices, published NPM modules, and written CLIs. I also have a knack for organizing really great hackathons (I've designed and hosted 95 of them so far)

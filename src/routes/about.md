# About Me

My name is Monarch Wadia. I'm a senior software developer and startup CEO, and my work centers around the intersection of software engineering and online community building.

I live with my wife in the suburbs of Toronto, Canada. I enjoy taking long walks in nature, reading science fiction, listening to King Crimson, and watching Star Trek. My friends think I'm a geek, and I whole-heartedly agree.

## How to get in touch with me

The best way to reach me is via social media.
